## About Me

I'm a prospective Ph.D. student and currently a Research Technician at the [CoNCH lab](https://www.conchlab.uwo.ca/), Center for Brain and Mind, Western University, London, Ontario. I hold a M.Sc. in Neuroscience and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering.

## Research Interests
- **Cognitive Neuroscience:** Examining neural mechanisms behind cognitive processes, with a focus on naturalistic stimuli related to hearing and speech.
- **Computational Neuroscience:** Utilizing computational methods to model auditory and speech processing in the brain.
- **Neuroimaging:** Employing neuroimaging techniques to investigate the neural basis of auditory and speech functions, with clinical applications in mind.

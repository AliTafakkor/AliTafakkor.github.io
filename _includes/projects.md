## EpLink

I am involved in EpLink, a major research program funded by the [Ontario Brain Institute](https://braininstitute.ca/eplink), dedicated to helping individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy. EpLink, one of the largest multidisciplinary epilepsy research programs in North America, boasts over 35 researchers working on more than 40 projects across Ontario. Our team is focused on discovering and enhancing treatments for seizures, including drug therapy, diet therapy, seizure prediction and brain stimulation, surgical therapy, genetic testing, and quality of life improvements.

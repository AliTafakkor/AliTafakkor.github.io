Imagine a crowded theater where everyone is watching a movie together. For most people, their brains are in sync, reacting similarly to the exciting or emotional scenes on the screen. This shared experience is much like what happens in our brains when we watch a movie: specific areas light up in harmony, a phenomenon detectable through a brain imaging technique called fMRI.

Now, consider that one in 300 people in this theater may suffer from medication-resistant epilepsy. For these individuals, pinpointing the brain areas causing seizures is crucial. Surgery can help, but it often requires risky and expensive procedures.

We're exploring if these synchronized brain patterns during movie watching can help locate epileptic tissue safely and cost-effectively. By comparing the brain activity of people with epilepsy to healthy individuals, we hope to detect differences and identify problem areas. This innovative approach could make epilepsy treatment safer and more accessible.
